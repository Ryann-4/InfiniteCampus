                <span style="color:magenta;">
                    1. Your Schools' Internet Blocks The Site
                    <br>
                    2. Site May Be Down Or Disabled
                    <br>
                    3. Your School May Have Special Settings Enabled For The Wifi Or Just The Computers

                    Simplest Answer: 
                    <br>
                    Use A Hotspot Or Connect To A Different Network
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another Answer Is Use A VPN
                    <br>
                    VPNs Can Take Your IP, MAC Address, And Other Settings And Make It Appear Like You Are Elsewhere
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A Good VPN To Use That I Reccommend Is Hiddify VPN Free On The Google Play Store (You Have To Find Your Own Config Url)
